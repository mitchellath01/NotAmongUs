How to play?
Type a command word such as
GOTO, QUESTION, MAP, SEARCH, QUIT, JOURNAL, WATCH
Actions such as GOTO need a place to go to, so use it like this:
GOTO MAINDECK, room names do not contain spaces!
Each action you take takes time!
The time is 8 pm, the game needs you to finish by 10 pm!
Good luck...
